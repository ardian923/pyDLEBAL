## Double Layer Model for Energy Balance in Vegetated Surface



### Water Flow in Soil due to Infiltration or Evaporation
....Water flow in soil when there is gradient in soil matric pressure. The gradient could occur through infiltration (water in soil surface) or evaporation flux (vapor movement in soil surface)

### Heat Flow in Soil
